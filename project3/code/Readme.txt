For implements of four classification algorithms:
Data samples are dataset1.txt and dataset2.txt, please make sure these two files are at the same folder with the py files mentions below.

knn
1. Run command 'python knn.py' in terminal
2. filename variable in main function is the name of dataset
3. k variable in main function is the number of the nearest neighbors
4. The annotated code in the main function is used to calculate demo dataset without 10-fold cross validation.

decisionTree
run decisionTree.py 

naive bayes
run naive.py 	// -口·口-

random forests
run randomForest.py

For kaggle:
Data samples are train_features.csv, train_label.csv and test_features.csv, please make sure these three files are at the same folder with the py files mentions below.
1. Run command 'python kaggle.py' in terminal
2. The results will be stored in the current folder as. cvs files
